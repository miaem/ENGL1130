                <h3>Towers</h3>
                All of the towers are spread across the United States. They are located in large, populated cities near
                the coast. Why though? My hypothesis is that locating the towers in a populated area helped integrate
                the idea of medical exploitation and experimentation in society to make it publicly acceptable.
                Surrounding these towers with people made it seem like the Big Eye had nothing to hide and what they
                were doing was ethical. If, lets say, Okorafor chose to locate the towers in a rural setting with a low
                population of people, the towers would be seen as secretive and raise suspicion. The towers do indeed
                draw less attention when centered in populated areas.
                <br><br>
                We know have an idea as to why the towers are in popular cities but why near the coast? This may seem
                more obvious, but Okorafor is most likely trying to allude to slave trade. It was easier to import and
                export people from the coastline, especially considering that they would be arriving by boat.
                <br><br>
                Another thing to note is that these towers are not concentrated in one place. They are spread across the
                US. The dispersion of the towers may be a way to alienate and isolate the specimen. Distribution the
                towers in this way also disconnect them. Restricting communication could be a way of preventing
                rebellion.
                <br><br>
                Isolating the towers to locations on Earth may be playing into the genre of science fiction, considering
                that this book is of that genre. Each tower could be compared to different plants that contain
                "outsiders" or "aliens."
                <h3>Slave Trade Route</h3>
                Phoenix's path throughout the book mimics the slave trade route. She does this to demonstrate her
                frustration with history but also help remember it. Travelling cross-continentally also plays on her
                idea of Africanfuturism. If Phoenix did not travel to Ghana, the activity of the book would have been
                geographically concentrated in the US. Visually, there is a lot of water crossed. Crossing from America
                to Ghana or vice versa is done via land (Saeed), sea (Specimen) and air (Phoenix).
                <h3>Origin</h3>
                The characters and specimen originate from North, East and West Africa, but mostly West Africa. In
                history, a majority of all people enslaved in the US came from West and Central Africa. In relation to
                the slave trade route, obtaining slaves from these locations made it easier to transport them. The very
                high concentration of people from Africa who are taken away from their countries contrast with the
                location of activity in the book, highlighting the exploitation of African for economic interests.
                <h3>Explosions</h3>
                Phoenix's first and last explosion were located in New York. The cyclical completion of the her path
                also reflects the slave trade route. These explosions may reflect revenge and frustration with the route
                in attempt to both remember and destroy the past.
                <h3>West vs. East</h3>
                There are distinct differences based on geography in this book. Almost all of the specimen are from the
                East. They are all located at the Towers in the West. Black bodies are treated differently across the
                water.
                In the East, black patients are treated with care in an ethical way. In the West, black bodies are
                exploited in an unethical way. People also view Phoenix differently across regions. People in Ghana see
                Phoenix as a Savior. Americans consider Phoenix to be a villain.
